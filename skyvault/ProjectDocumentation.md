# Project Documentation: SkyVault Dreamy Pastel Edition

**Title**  
SkyVault – Magical Pastel Cloud Login (Aesthetic UI Version)

**Aim**  
To develop a visually magical, bright, and pastel-themed frontend-only cloud web application focusing on a premium aesthetic login experience.

**Objective**  
• **Pastel Aesthetic:** Use ONLY soft, bright colours like baby pink, sky blue, and lavender.  
• **Magical UI:** Implement glitter/sparkle animations and floating blobs for a dreamy feel.  
• **Glassmorphism:** Use high-transparency frosted glass effects for the main UI components.  
• **Interactive Feedback:** Provide micro-interactions like scaling buttons and focused input glows.

**Software Used**  
Google AI Studio, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Web Browser.

**Project Description**  
This project is a specialized "Aesthetic" version of SkyVault.
1. **LoginPage:** A bright, magical interface with a moving pastel gradient background. It features a centered glassmorphism card with sparkling details and soft floating shapes.
2. **Design Language:** Heavily inspired by "kawaii" and modern "creamy" web design trends, prioritizing brightness and soft contrast over traditional dark modes.

**Files Used**  
• `index.html` – Single file containing all styling, structure, and logic.

**Steps Involved**  
1. **Palette Selection:** Curated a selection of hex codes for baby pink (#FFD1DC), mint, and sky blue.
2. **Animation Engine:** Created CSS `@keyframes` for the gradient background and the sparkle overlay.
3. **Glassmorphism Layer:** Configured `backdrop-filter` and high-transparency backgrounds to create the frosted effect.
4. **Logic:** Wrote a lightweight JavaScript handler for field validation and dummy authentication.

**Output**  
A high-end, bright, and cute login experience that looks professional yet magical. The UI is completely devoid of dark colors, ensuring a consistent aesthetic theme throughout.
